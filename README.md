# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays

This repository contains all project materials for the CS3-4002 case study, focused on developing a deep learning model to assist clinicians in identifying pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

🩺 Mission Brief
You're part of a data science team supporting a major hospital facing a surge in patients with respiratory symptoms. Radiologists are overwhelmed—and time is critical. Your mission is to build a high-performing deep learning model that can accurately flag potential pneumonia cases, helping clinicians make faster decisions.

Pneumonia remains one of the top causes of death from infectious disease globally. Accurate and rapid diagnosis is key—especially for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly. By leveraging the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), your goal is to develop a tool that can make a real-world impact.

🎯 Project Objective
Build and train a CNN-based deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray scans.

Use transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet50).

Achieve at least 75% classification accuracy.

❓ Research Question
What deep learning techniques and image features are most effective for accurately detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images?
